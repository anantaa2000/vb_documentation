<h2 id="intoduction">Intoduction:</h2>
<p>The objective of this task is to implement a Warehouse Management System to sort packages based on incoming customer orders from different cities. To achieve this we had done the  following things:</p>
<p>1.)Identied the colour of  12 packages, on shelf using Camera#1. Using QR decoding and the updated the Inventory management spreadsheet of the wharehouse using ROS-IOT BRIDGE </p>
<p>2.)Then to recieve the incomming orders published on topic "/eyrc/vb/JaiMataD/orders" we used our ros iot bridge and subscribed to it for getting orders</p>
<p>3.) After recieving orders ur5_1 arm picks the desired package from the shelf according to ine incoming order ie (medcines food or clothes) and place it on the conveyor belt</p>
<p>4.) After placing the box on conveyor the orders dispatched sheet in the IMS spreadsheet is updated via ros-iot-bridge and an email alert regarding dispatched order is send to the desired email id (usig g-script)</p>
<p>5.) While dispatching a costuom message is published bt node_t5_ur5_1 which contains the detected color and othe details of the package dispatched </p>
<p>6.) When package reaches ur5_2 arm it is detected by the logical camera 2 and the sorted into different colored bins by the ur5_2 arm with the help or color message that was published by ur5_1 node </p>
<p>7.) When pkg is dropped in the sorting bin the order shipped sheet of IMS spreadsheet is updated and another email alert is sent to the desired email id regarding shipped item </p>

<h2 id="implementation">Implementation</h2>
<p>To implement this task we have created  2 nodes ( node_t5_ur5_1 and node_t5_ur5_2 ) to control both the ur5 arms seperately and  another pkg ie Ros-Iot-Bridge to handle all commumication between ros and iot server and spread sheets </p>
<h3 id="pkg_task5">pkg_task5:</h3>
<p>This is the main package for task 5 which contains all scripts, launch file , config files and saved bag files required for this task.</p>
<h4 id="scripts">SCRIPTS:</h4>
<p>There are 2 scripts node_t5_ur5_1.py and node_t5_ur5_2.py for different ur5 arms</p>
<h5 id="node_t5_ur5_1py">node_t5_ur5_1.py:</h5>
<p>this node controls ur5_1 arm which is near thhe shelf and is  used to pic and place boxes from shelf on to the conveyor belt 
in this node first we have subscribed to the 2d camera which gives the imaage feed of the shelf . using pyzbar , cv2 library we have detected all 12 pkgs on shelf with their colors and stored the data in list (cotaining list of color , and position on shelf )
then we have seperated all the differnt color pkgs in different lists and while doing so we have also updated our inventory managemant spreadsheet  usnng ros iot bridge 
after which we have subscribed for the incomming messages,  when the message is recieved it is published in the incomming orders spread sheet and the ur5_1 starts moving to pick and place the box 
once the box is placed on the conveyor the dispatched order spread sheet is updated via ros--iot-bridge and email notification is sent to user and the color of the box along with other order details is published on a costom topic which will be subscribed bt the node_t5_ur5_2 for sorting the pkg </p>
<p>if multiple orders are comming at same time then the orders are processed in the order of priority  ie meds  first then food and then clothes 
this is attained by sorting the incommngi order based on order is as the order id for differnt priority orders is differnt </p>
<h5 id="class-methods-and-functions">Class methods and functions:</h5>
<p>This script is used to control ur5_1 arm and read incoming orders and process them according to the inventory and control 2D cam which detects all the packages in the shelf with their colour and relative position in the shelf.</p>

</code></pre>
<h5 id="node_t5_ur5_2">node_t5_ur5_2 :</h5>
<p>this node is used to control the ur5_2 arm and sort the pkgs into correct color bin 
this is achieved by subscrbing to the logical camera 2 which detets the incomming pkg on the coneyor and when pkg reaches certain position under the cam  the cnveyr belt is stopped and the box is attached to the arm and by subscribing to the custom topic published in node_t5_ur5_1 containing color and other details the package is sorted into sorting bins
